# which we need to find_package() individually:
#   roscpp (the client library)
#   std_msgs (contains the std_msgs/String message type)

# We've found them; now use their variables in the usual way to configure
# the compile and link steps.
# Note: we skip calling link_directories() because ROS packages follow the
# recommended CMake practice of returning absolute paths to libraries
